## What is Mercury?

Mercury is an open-source framework that makes it **simple to share Python notebooks with non-technical users**.  
You write your analysis in a notebook; Mercury turns it into a **clean, responsive web app** with interactive widgets and no frontend code.

Our goal is to help people - especially in **science, research, and data-heavy work** - share their results easily ❤️

## Why Mercury?

<CardGrid >

  <Card title="No frontend required" icon="pen">
    Stay in Python and your notebook. Mercury takes care of the web layout, navigation, and styling automatically.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Rich interactive widgets" icon="setting">
    Build interactive apps with a wide library of widgets. When a widget value changes, cells below it are automatically recomputed — no callbacks to maintain.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Designed for non-technical users" icon="comment">
    Share results with colleagues who do not code. They get a simple, friendly web interface; you keep full control in Python.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Clean layout by default" icon="laptop">
    Mercury gives your notebook a nice, consistent layout out of the box. You focus on the analysis, not on CSS or HTML.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Easy deployment" icon="rocket">
    Run your app in Docker or deploy to our cloud with no complex setup. From notebook to shared app in minutes.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Live preview while you work" icon="magnifier">
    See a live preview of your app directly in **MLJAR Studio** or **JupyterLab** (via our extension). Adjust widgets and layout and instantly see the result.
  </Card>

</CardGrid>

## How does Mercury work?

1. **Create a notebook in Python**  
   Use your usual environment: JupyterLab or MLJAR Studio.

2. **Add Mercury widgets**  
   Insert widgets in your notebook cells. They are interactive and automatically trigger re-execution of cells below them.

3. **Preview your app live**  
   Use the built-in extension to see how your notebook looks as a web app while you edit.

4. **Deploy with Docker or cloud**  
   Package your notebook with Docker or use our cloud deployment. No complicated server setup needed.
