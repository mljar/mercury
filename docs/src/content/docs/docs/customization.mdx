description: Customize the look and feel of Mercury web apps
---

We want you to customize your web apps so they look and feel exactly the way you like.

To do this, create a file called `config.toml` in the same directory as your notebooks.

```toml
[main]
title = "Mercury"
footer = "MLJAR - next generation of AI tools"
favicon_emoji = "🎉"

[welcome]
header = ""
message = ""
```

## What you can customize

* **`title`** – the title of your web app
* **`footer`** – text shown at the bottom of the page
* **`favicon_emoji`** – emoji shown as the browser tab icon
* **`welcome.header`** – optional welcome header
* **`welcome.message`** – optional welcome message for users

Feel free to change these values and make the app your own.

We are actively working on adding **more customization options**.
If something is missing or you would like to customize more things, please let us know - your feedback really matters to us 🚀
