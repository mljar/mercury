The **UploadFile** widget lets users upload one or more files using **drag & drop** or a **file picker**.
Uploaded files are immediately available in Python as byte data, making it easy to load datasets, images, or documents in your Mercury App.

## Live Demo

You can try the `UploadFile` widget directly in this interactive example:

/> 


## Usage

To create an UploadFile widget, provide a `label`.
The uploaded content is available via `.value`, `.name`, or `.files`.

### Basic Example

**Code**

```python
import mercury as mr

uploader = mr.UploadFile(
    label="Upload CSV"
)
```

To access the uploaded file:

```python
uploader.name
uploader.value
```

* `name` → file name
* `value` → file content as `bytes`

---

### Multiple Files

Enable uploading multiple files using `multiple=True`.

**Code**

```python
uploader = mr.UploadFile(
    label="Upload images",
    multiple=True
)
```

Iterate over uploaded files:

```python
for f in uploader:
    print(f.name, len(f.value))
```

You can also access all files directly:

```python
uploader.files
```

---

### File Size Limit

Use `max_file_size` to limit the size of each uploaded file.

Supported units:

* `KB`
* `MB`
* `GB`

**Code**

```python
uploader = mr.UploadFile(
    label="Upload dataset",
    max_file_size="10MB"
)
```

If a file exceeds the limit, the user is notified and the file is not uploaded.

---

### Layout

Use the `position` argument to control where the widget is displayed.
The default is `position="sidebar"`.

Available positions:

* `"sidebar"` — displayed in the left sidebar (default)
* `"inline"` — displayed in the main notebook output
* `"bottom"` — displayed after all notebook cells

**Code**

```python
mr.UploadFile(
    label="Upload report",
    position="inline"
)
```

---

## UploadFile Props

### label

**type:** `string`

Text displayed above the upload area.
The default is `"Upload file"`.

---

### max_file_size

**type:** `string`

Maximum allowed size per file.

Examples:

* `"500KB"`
* `"10MB"`
* `"1GB"`

The default is `"100MB"`.

---

### multiple

**type:** `bool`

If `True`, allows uploading multiple files.
The default is `False`.

---

### position

**type:** `"sidebar" | "inline" | "bottom"`

Controls where the widget is rendered:

* **sidebar** — in the sidebar (default)
* **inline** — directly in the notebook cell output
* **bottom** — after all notebook cells

---

### disabled

**type:** `bool`

If `True`, the widget is visible but cannot be interacted with.
The default is `False`.

---

### hidden

**type:** `bool`

If `True`, the widget exists in the UI state but is not rendered.
The default is `False`.

---

### key

**type:** `string`

Unique identifier used to distinguish widgets with identical arguments.

<Aside>
If the same code cell is run again, Mercury reuses the previous widget instance unless a different `key` is specified.

The `key` value is required when widgets are created inside loops.

## Notes

* Uploaded files are stored **in memory**, not saved to disk automatically.
* Each uploaded file is represented as an `UploadedFile` object with:

  * `.name` — file name
  * `.value` — file content as `bytes`
* For `multiple=False`, `.value` and `.name` refer to the **first file**.
* Use `.files` or iteration to handle multiple uploads.
