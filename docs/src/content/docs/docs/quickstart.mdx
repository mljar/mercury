Mercury detects all Python notebooks available in the current directory and serve them as web apps. Please run the following command to start server:

<Code code={`mercury`} lang='bash' title='Start Mercury Server'/>

It should open a web page at `localhost:8888` with information that no notebooks found if there are no notebooks (`*.ipynb` files) in the current directory you should see 

<Image 
  src={noNotebooksImg} 
  alt="Mercury with no notebooks" 
  class="docs-image-100"
/>

## Create a notebook

Let's create a first notebook with `TextInput` widget. The notebook will ask for user name and display welcome message.

```python
# first cell with imports
from mercury import TextInput
```

```python
# create interactive widget
name = TextInput(label="What is yout name?")
```

```python
# display widget value
print(f"Hey {name.value}!")
```

## Live preview

In **MLJAR Studio** or **JupyterLab** editor please click on confetti icon in the top toolbar to open a live app preview.

<Image 
  src={liveAppPreviewImg} 
  alt="Mercury with no notebooks" 
  class="docs-image-100"
/>

<Aside type="note" title="Cell re-execution in live app preview">
Mercury automatically re-execute cells below updated widget. This feature is available only when serving notebooks with Mercury or when live preview is open during development.
</Aside>

## Start server

Start a server with command:

```bash
mercury
```

You should see a card with notebook. The title in the card will be the same as notebook filename.
