## Log level

Would you like to see more logs from `mercury`?  
Please use `--log-level=INFO` or `--log-level=DEBUG`. The default log level is `CRITICAL`.

## Session sharing

We have option to share the same session between multiple users.  
What does it mean? You can deploy app, and when you click on it, others will see this.  
To enable session sharing please use `--keep-session`. 

## Timeout

Would you like to limit your server resources with usage timeout?  
Please set `--timeout=600`. The timeout value is in seconds.
