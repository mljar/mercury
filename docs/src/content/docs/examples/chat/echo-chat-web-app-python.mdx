title: Basic echo chat web app in Python
description: Create a basic echo chat web application in Python with the Mercury framework. The chat will accept a user prompt and respond with the same message. You will learn how to use the Chat, ChatInput, and Message widgets from Mercury. This is a good start for building more advanced chat apps.

Have you ever heard an echo in the mountains, a cave, or a tunnel?
An echo is a simple response: it repeats your voice back to you.

In this tutorial, we will build a simple **Echo Chat Bot**.
It will respond with the same text that the user typed.

You will learn how to use these Mercury widgets:

* `Chat` (`/docs/chat/chat/`)
* `ChatInput` (`/docs/chat/chatinput/`)
* `Message` (`/docs/chat/message/`)

Below is the screenshot of echo bot developed in Python notebook. In the left there is notebook code, in the right there is live app preview:

/> 


## 1. Import Mercury

In the first notebook cell, import Mercury:

```python
import mercury as mr
```

We will use `mr` alias to create all widgets.

## 2. Create the chat area

In the next cell, create a place where all messages will be displayed:

```python 
chat = mr.Chat()
```

Yes, it is that simple :)

## 3. Add an input for the user prompt

Now we need `ChatInput` to let the user type a message:

```python
prompt = mr.ChatInput()
```

When user enters the text and send it, this automatically re-execute cells below. 

## 4. Echo the message back

In the next cell, we will:

1. Create a message from the user input
2. Add it to the chat
3. Create the assistant response (`Echo: ...`)
4. Add it to the chat

```python 
if prompt.value:
    # user message
    user_msg = mr.Message(prompt.value, role="user")
    chat.add(user_msg)

    # assistant message (echo)
    response_msg = mr.Message(
        f"Echo: {prompt.value}",
        role="assistant",
        emoji="🤖",
    )
    chat.add(response_msg)
```

## How it works

* `prompt.value` contains the latest user input.
* `mr.Message(..., role="user")` creates a message from the user.
* `mr.Message(..., role="assistant")` creates a message from the bot.
* `chat.add(...)` appends messages to the chat view.

## Next steps

This echo bot is a great starting point. Next you can:

* Replace the echo response with an LLM call (OpenAI, Ollama, OpenRouter, Anthropic, Mistral, Bielik, etc.).
* Add system prompts and tools for an agent-like chat.
* Build interactive responses with charts and tables.
