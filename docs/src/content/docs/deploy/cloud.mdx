import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Deploying Mercury apps in the cloud is the **simplest and fastest** way to share your notebooks as web applications.  
The Mercury Cloud service takes care of servers, configuration, and infrastructure, so you can focus entirely on your notebooks and your users.

Below is a step-by-step guide that walks you through the entire process.

--- 

<Steps>

1. **Create an account**

   Start by creating an account at  
   [platform.mljar.com](https://platform.mljar.com).

   This account will be used to manage your Mercury applications, deployments, and secrets in one place.

2. **Open the Pages section**

   After logging in, navigate to the **Pages** section in the dashboard.

   Pages are used to host Mercury applications and control how they are deployed and exposed to users.

3. **Create a new site**

   Click **Create new site** and choose a name for your application.  
   This site will represent a single Mercury web app.

4. **Upload your files**

   Upload all files required by your application. This typically includes:

   - Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) with Mercury apps
   - Data files such as `.csv` or `.xls`
   - A `requirements.txt` file with additional Python dependencies
   - A `config.toml` file with Mercury configuration (optional)

   Once uploaded, Mercury Cloud will automatically prepare the environment for your app.

5. **Define secrets (optional)**

   In the **Pages** view, you can define **secrets** for your application.

   Secrets are a safe place to store sensitive information such as:
   - database connection strings,
   - API keys,
   - access tokens,
   - or credentials required by external services.

   These values are never exposed in your notebooks or source files. 
   Notebooks access them as environment variables.

</Steps>

That's it!  
After completing these steps, your Mercury application will be built and deployed in the cloud, ready to be shared with others.
