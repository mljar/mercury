Mercury allows you to turn Python notebooks into fully interactive web applications and deploy them with very little effort.  
Depending on your needs, you can choose between **self-hosting** or using a **managed cloud service**.

This section of the documentation explains the available deployment options and helps you decide which one best fits your use case.

### Which option should you choose?

- **Docker deployment** is recommended if you want full control over the environment, need to run Mercury on your own infrastructure, or prefer a reproducible setup for development and production.
- **Cloud deployment** is the simplest option if you want to focus on your notebooks and users, without dealing with servers, Docker images, or configuration.

Both approaches allow you to deploy the same Mercury notebooks — only the hosting method differs.


### Need help with deployment?

If you have questions, encounter issues, or something does not work as expected, please **create an issue** in the Mercury repository.  
We actively monitor issues and are happy to help.

If you need help with **more advanced setups** — for example:
- deploying Mercury inside your company infrastructure,
- running it behind authentication or a proxy,
- integrating it with existing systems,
- or preparing a production-ready environment,

we also offer **paid support and consulting**.
